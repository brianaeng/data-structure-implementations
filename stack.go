// Implement Top for a Stack using only Push(e) and Pop. (Note: This is an example of extending functionality without knowing the implementation details of how the Stack is implemented i.e. not knowing whether the Stack is implemented using an array or a linked list). Assume the data contained is int.
// Write a function to reverse a string (the funciton takes a string as input parameter) using a Stack.
// Write a function to print all integer values in a binary tree in pre-order traversal iteratively. (Hint: Use a Stack.)
